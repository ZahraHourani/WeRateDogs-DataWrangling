# WeRateDogs-DataWrangling
In this project, I focus on Wrangle The WeRateDogs Archive . The dataset that I will be  wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates,  also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a  humorous comment about the dog.
